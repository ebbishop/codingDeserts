Purpose:
Create a map of computer science (or programming) education programs for children 
and teens, to allow parents to see what programs are available in their geographical 
area  and allow schools to advertise their programs in a central repository.

A comprehensive mapping application would allow us to see if there are CS education 'deserts' 
(e.g. areas that are underserved or completely lacking in opportunities for kids to learn about CS).


Rationale
In thinking about the issue of the lack of diversity in technology, we chose to approach 
the problem as an issue of lack of access to educational opportunities for children and teens - 
the idea being, if young people don't have access to learn about technology in their fomative years, 
it's less likely that they will seek out career paths in technology once they're in college and beyond.

Our project, Coding Deserts Map, seeks to map technology education opportunities in New York City for youth.

The term “Coding Deserts” is a play on the phrase “Food Desert", which has in recent years come to mean 
an area of a city without access to supermarkets selling healthy food (need to check this definition).

By analogy, a “Coding Desert” is a geographical area or neighborhood without access to CS or programming 
educational opportunities.

We went into this with an open mind - we're not sure if these Coding Deserts actually exist - so this was 
part research project, part coding challenge.
